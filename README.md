## Requirements

To run this model, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- os
- shutil
- ultralytics
- zipfile

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib ultralytics
```

## Usage
Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiple-myeloma-plasma-cells-segmentation.git
```



## Additional Information

- The segmentation model is based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, which is known for its efficiency in real-time object detection.
- Input images should be pre-processed and formatted according to the model's requirements.
- Outputs will be generated in the specified output directory.
